### Hello everyone ðŸŒ…

I'm a french software engineer using that account for personal project and open source contributions.
You might find some of my work related contributions through [my other account](https://github.com/github-christophe-oudar).

Few things about me:
I'm mostly working around data at scale
I like to tinker around many topics around data engineering.
I often work with Scala, SQL & Typescript but I touch whatever I need to.

I'm building https://bqbooster.com on my free time.

You can reach me directly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Kayrnt) or at kayrnt 'at' gmail.com
